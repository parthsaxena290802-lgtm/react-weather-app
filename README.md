 🌦️ Weather Forecast Web App

A responsive weather forecast web application built using React.js that provides real-time weather information for any city worldwide.  



 📘 Overview

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in React.js, combining front-end development skills with API integration and responsive design principles.  
The app allows users to check real-time weather updates by entering a city name or using their current location. It fetches data through the OpenWeatherMap API and displays temperature, humidity, and other conditions in a clean, minimal interface.
